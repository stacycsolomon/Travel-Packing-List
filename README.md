### A Trip Planner App

This application was designed for the frequent flyer, to allow travelers to stay organized for upcoming travel. Users are able to create an account, and have a central location that they can use to keep track of upcoming trips. A user will be able to show all trips, add new trips, update or delete existing trips.

You can find the deployed application here.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to create an account
* As a user, I want to be able to sign in, change my password and sign out
* As a user, I want to be able to add a trip to my account that will include the trip destination, travel dates, and length of stay
* As a user, once my trip is created I want to be able to create a packing list
* As a user, I want to be able to leave an optional trip review or comments about my trip


### Technologies Used

* Node JS
* Express JS
* MongoDB
* Mongoose

### Images 

Below I have created the entity relationship diagram for this application. So far, the application is in its initial state, ie, version 1. A user will be able to have many trips, and each trip will have one packing list, and one trip review/comment section.

### Improvements

* Build out Version 2 and Version 3 to include the additional entity relationships.
